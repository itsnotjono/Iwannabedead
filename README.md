2D platform rpg where your character 

Categories:



Goal: The world is split into 3+ sections with progressive themes and difficulty, to progress you must fight your way to the end boss
kill that nigga and make it to the next town. 

World: The world begins in a town, where your character can spend gold, buy supplies and open dialogue with townsfolk. Townsfolk can give advice on where to find hidden tresure, enemy weaknesses and progress foward. Since the camera is locked to your character the background can be repeated scenery, but will change when you move to another area (Entering a dungeon for instance). Having it animated would b lit.
The foreground will consist of your character, enemys, the general terrain or 'path' and objects which block projectiles and
must be used wisely to mitigate incoming damage. Some objects may hurt you, help you kill enemys or uncover secret paths or
items.

You have unlimited lives but when you die you lose a % of your exp and money

Enemys: Throw projectiles, respawn when character view distance is faw away and award gold and exp.
Enemys may be able to hop along the ground, have the ability to climb, fly and have various sizes and abilities of their own but 

Note: Enemys should be created ground up starting with a concept first and developed to suit the enemy design. This keeps the
enemy design from being stale and gives it life, this means they need to suit their enviroment, have appropriate abilities
and movement patterns 

Projectiles: Projectiles from enemys will be fairly slow moving, enough to be able to dodge giving the combat a bullet hell feel where
you must learn enemy attacks and anicipiate incoming shots and prioritize the appropriate enemys. Theres a lot of room for creativity but be careful projectiles arnt too diffucult to see against the background or are undodgeable.
